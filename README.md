# Don't miss tweets from your favourite people!

When you follow a lot of people on Twitter, it’s easy for the more frequent tweeters to drown out the less frequent but important tweets of your friends, colleagues and influencers whom you don't want to miss.

**Sappy** is a chrome extension that allows you to focus on what’s important. Filtering the tweets that matter to you, instead of letting them get lost in the ocean of tweets!

Sappy further ensures that you focus more on what matters that is the tweets, instead of the distracting right sidebar covering scandalous events and news or the gigantic menu labels on Twitter, thereby, ensuring better productivity and reduced distractions.
