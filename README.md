# Don't miss tweets from your favourite people!

When you follow more than a dozen people, it’s easy for the most frequent tweeters to drown out the less-frequent but equally important voices of your dearest friends or valued colleagues.

**Sappy** is a chrome extension that allows you to focus on what’s important. Filtering the tweets that matter to you, instead of letting them get lost in a sea of tweets!

Sappy further ensures that you focus more on the tweets instead of the 0distracting right sidebar covering scandalous events and news or the gigantic menu labels on Twitter. Thereby ensuring reduced distractions and better productivity.
